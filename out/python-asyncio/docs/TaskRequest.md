## Example

```python
from asana_asyncio.models.task_request import TaskRequest

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of TaskRequest from a JSON string
task_request_instance = TaskRequest.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print TaskRequest.to_json()

# convert the object into a dict
task_request_dict = task_request_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of TaskRequest from a dict
task_request_form_dict = task_request.from_dict(task_request_dict)
