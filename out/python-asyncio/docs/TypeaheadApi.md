Get objects via typeahead

<b>Required scope: </b><code>workspace.typeahead:read</code>

Retrieves objects in the workspace based via an auto-completion/typeahead
search algorithm. This feature is meant to provide results quickly, so do
not rely on this API to provide extremely accurate search results. The
result set is limited to a single page of results with a maximum size, so
you won’t be able to fetch large numbers of results.

The typeahead search API provides search for objects from a single
workspace. This endpoint should be used to query for objects when
creating an auto-completion/typeahead search feature. This API is meant
to provide results quickly and should not be relied upon for accurate or
exhaustive search results. The results sets are limited in size and
cannot be paginated.

Queries return a compact representation of each object which is typically
the gid and name fields. Interested in a specific set of fields or all of
the fields?! Of course you are. Use field selectors to manipulate what
data is included in a response.

Resources with type `user` are returned in order of most contacted to
least contacted. This is determined by task assignments, adding the user
to projects, and adding the user as a follower to tasks, messages,
etc.

Resources with type `project` are returned in order of recency. This is
determined when the user visits the project, is added to the project, and
completes tasks in the project.

Resources with type `task` are returned with priority placed on tasks
the user is following, but no guarantee on the order of those tasks.

Resources with type `project_template` are returned with priority
placed on favorited project templates.

Leaving the `query` string empty or omitted will give you results, still
following the resource ordering above. This could be used to list users or
projects that are relevant for the requesting user's api token.

### Example

* OAuth Authentication (oauth2):

```python
import asana_asyncio
from asana_asyncio.models.typeahead_for_workspace200_response import TypeaheadForWorkspace200Response
from asana_asyncio.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://app.asana.com/api/1.0
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = asana_asyncio.Configuration(
    host = "https://app.asana.com/api/1.0"
)

# The client must configure the authentication and authorization parameters
# in accordance with the API server security policy.
# Examples for each auth method are provided below, use the example that
# satisfies your auth use case.

configuration.access_token = os.environ["ACCESS_TOKEN"]

# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
async with asana_asyncio.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = asana_asyncio.TypeaheadApi(api_client)
    workspace_gid = '12345' # str | Globally unique identifier for the workspace or organization.
    resource_type = user # str | The type of values the typeahead should return. You can choose from one of the following: `custom_field`, `goal`, `project`, `project_template`, `portfolio`, `tag`, `task`, `team`, and `user`. Note that unlike in the names of endpoints, the types listed here are in singular form (e.g. `task`). Using multiple types is not yet supported. (default to user)
    type = user # str | *Deprecated: new integrations should prefer the resource_type field.* (optional) (default to user)
    query = 'Greg' # str | The string that will be used to search for relevant objects. If an empty string is passed in, the API will return results. (optional)
    count = 20 # int | The number of results to return. The default is 20 if this parameter is omitted, with a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 100. If there are fewer results found than requested, all will be returned. (optional)
    opt_pretty = true # bool | Provides “pretty” output. Provides the response in a “pretty” format. In the case of JSON this means doing proper line breaking and indentation to make it readable. This will take extra time and increase the response size so it is advisable only to use this during debugging. (optional)
    opt_fields = ['[\"name\"]'] # List[str] | This endpoint returns a resource which excludes some properties by default. To include those optional properties, set this query parameter to a comma-separated list of the properties you wish to include. (optional)

    try:
        # Get objects via typeahead
        api_response = await api_instance.typeahead_for_workspace(workspace_gid, resource_type, type=type, query=query, count=count, opt_pretty=opt_pretty, opt_fields=opt_fields)
        print("The response of TypeaheadApi->typeahead_for_workspace:\n")
        pprint(api_response)
    except Exception as e:
        print("Exception when calling TypeaheadApi->typeahead_for_workspace: %s\n" % e)
```

 **type** | **str**| *Deprecated: new integrations should prefer the resource_type field.* | [optional] [default to user]
 **query** | **str**| The string that will be used to search for relevant objects. If an empty string is passed in, the API will return results. | [optional]

### Return type

[**TypeaheadForWorkspace200Response**](TypeaheadForWorkspace200Response.md)

### Authorization

[oauth2](../README.md#oauth2)

### HTTP request headers

 - **Content-Type**: Not defined
 - **Accept**: application/json

### HTTP response details

| Status code | Description | Response headers |
|-------------|-------------|------------------|
**200** | Successfully retrieved objects via a typeahead search algorithm. |  -  |
**400** | This usually occurs because of a missing or malformed parameter. Check the documentation and the syntax of your request and try again. |  -  |
**401** | A valid authentication token was not provided with the request, so the API could not associate a user with the request. |  -  |
**403** | The authentication and request syntax was valid but the server is refusing to complete the request. This can happen if you try to read or write to objects or properties that the user does not have access to. |  -  |
**404** | Either the request method and path supplied do not specify a known action in the API, or the object specified by the request does not exist. |  -  |
**500** | There was a problem on Asana’s end. In the event of a server error the response body should contain an error phrase. These phrases can be used by Asana support to quickly look up the incident that caused the server error. Some errors are due to server load, and will not supply an error phrase. |  -  |
