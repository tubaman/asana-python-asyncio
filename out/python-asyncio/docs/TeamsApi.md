# **remove_user_for_team**

Remove a user from a team

The user making this call must be a member of the team in order to remove themselves or others.

### Example

* Bearer Authentication (personalAccessToken):
* OAuth Authentication (oauth2):

```python
import time
import os
import asana_asyncio
from asana_asyncio.models.delete_attachment200_response import DeleteAttachment200Response
from asana_asyncio.models.remove_user_for_team_request import RemoveUserForTeamRequest
from asana_asyncio.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://app.asana.com/api/1.0
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = asana_asyncio.Configuration(
    host = "https://app.asana.com/api/1.0"
)

# The client must configure the authentication and authorization parameters
# in accordance with the API server security policy.
# Examples for each auth method are provided below, use the example that
# satisfies your auth use case.

# Configure Bearer authorization: personalAccessToken
configuration = asana_asyncio.Configuration(
    access_token = os.environ["BEARER_TOKEN"]
)

configuration.access_token = os.environ["ACCESS_TOKEN"]

# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
async with asana_asyncio.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = asana_asyncio.TeamsApi(api_client)
    team_gid = '159874' # str | Globally unique identifier for the team.
    remove_user_for_team_request = asana_asyncio.RemoveUserForTeamRequest() # RemoveUserForTeamRequest | The user to remove from the team.
    opt_pretty = true # bool | Provides “pretty” output. Provides the response in a “pretty” format. In the case of JSON this means doing proper line breaking and indentation to make it readable. This will take extra time and increase the response size so it is advisable only to use this during debugging. (optional)

    try:
        # Remove a user from a team
        api_response = await api_instance.remove_user_for_team(team_gid, remove_user_for_team_request, opt_pretty=opt_pretty)
        print("The response of TeamsApi->remove_user_for_team:\n")
